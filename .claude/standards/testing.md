# Testing

- Tests are written and agreed before implementation — per the Plan phase of
  this project's agent workflow, the approved unit tests are what "done"
  means for a change. Implementation is written to satisfy tests that
  already exist, not the other way around.
- Favor many fast `unit`-marked tests over a few slow `integration`-marked
  ones. Reserve `integration` tests for the boundaries that genuinely can't
  be safely faked (a real database, a real network call, the filesystem) —
  everything else should be reachable with a unit test.
- Use `pytest-mock`'s `mocker` fixture for mocking, not manual
  `unittest.mock.patch` decorators or context managers — it's less
  boilerplate and composes better with other fixtures.
- Mock only true external boundaries (network, filesystem, time, randomness,
  a third-party API). Never mock the unit under test itself, and never mock
  an internal collaborator just to avoid constructing it — if a class is
  hard to construct for a test, that's a design smell to fix, not a reason
  to mock it away.
- The coverage floor enforced in `[tool.coverage.report]` (see
  `.claude/rules/pytest-rules.md` for the current threshold) applies to the
  whole `src/` tree, not a per-file target — critical or complex logic
  should be covered well above it, and trivial glue code isn't worth
  contorting a test to hit a number.
- `tests/conftest.py` enables live log output at `INFO` automatically when
  running `pytest -v` (via a `pytest_configure` hook that sets
  `log_cli_level` whenever `--verbose` is passed and no explicit
  `--log-cli-level` was given) — plain `pytest` stays quiet. This is the
  fast path to seeing what a test actually logged without digging through
  the failure-only "Captured log call" section; don't disable it by hand,
  and don't reach for `-s`/`print()` debugging when `pytest -v` already
  shows this. If the project uses `structlog` (see `logging.md`), its
  output only appears here once `structlog` is wired through stdlib
  `logging` — otherwise this hook has nothing to show.
- Test-file conventions — directory layout, `unit`/`integration` markers,
  `@pytest.mark.parametrize` style, naming — are covered in
  `.claude/rules/pytest-rules.md`, which loads automatically whenever a test
  file is touched. This document is the cross-cutting "why," that one is the
  file-level "how" — don't duplicate one into the other.

## Approved libraries

- `pytest`
- `pytest-cov` — coverage measurement, enforced via `[tool.coverage.report]`
- `pytest-mock` — mocking, in place of stdlib `unittest.mock` used directly
